# You've got red on you!

So I don't know about you, but I like buffing other players when I happen across them in the wilds of Azeroth.
Inconveniently (as I'm sure you know), buffing a PVP flagged player, flags you for the next 5minutes.
Sometimes you'll want to buff them anyway, other times when there are Warmode players from the opposing faction about maybe not so much.

As an added bonus it'll also alert you if you target an elite unfriendly NPC.
